# Portfolio of Gijs

Welcome to my Portfolio for the minor Virtual Reality.

## Who am I?
I'm a 4th year HBO-ICT Software Engineer with a background in full-stack development for .NET.

## What am I working on? (My Group & My Role)
During this minor, we worked on a project together with the University of Amsterdam in collaboration with WeMakeVR. The goal of this project was to create a VR application that was to make the user more aware of the plastic garbage they produce. I worked on this application together in a team called Virtual Birds, with Mike Tetteroo, Mirre Kersenberg, Vincent Vlaanderen-Oldenzaal en Jorn van 't Hof. My role in this group was as a general developer, concept-designer, tester, as well as a guide for my group to become familiar with modern development tools and operations.

## The Concept
Our vision for the application of this project was the following:<br/>
_"A virtual reality experience for the Oculus Quest where the user plays a role in a time-travelling story which forces them to confront the plastic garbage they produce."_

We chose a time-travel story because it ties in neatly with what we wanted to get from the user. We wanted the user to go grocery shopping. More specifically; we wanted the user to do their own groceries of a week in the past. In our story, when the user is sent back to the past, the time-machine breaks, which results in the user having to do their own groceries to "fix the past". 

When the user gets sent to the future, they are confronted with the multiplication of the result of their grocery shopping in the form of a big pile of garbage. We do this to create a shock-effect. We do want the user to have the feeling that they can actually do something about this problem though, so we decided later on that the user should be able to reflect on and change the garbage they produce by means of converting their purchased groceries into their more eco-friendly, less-plastic alternatives.

## The Product
In a nutshell, this video walks through our product as we have it right now:

## User Testing
During the making of this application, we made a lot of assumptions and decisions which need to be proven by User Tests. Unfortunately, the covid-19 crisis was at the height of this project's development so User Testing with our target group (inexperienced VR-users) became quite difficult. Nevertheless we managed to cook up some testplans, one of which was to test with our peers who worked on other VR projects. Because one of my learning goals was learning to user test, I made this questionnaire together with an experienced User Tester in our team (Jorn). This questionnaire was to be filled in by testers after playing our application. The results of this test are presented here:

Before this, during sprint 2, I also made a test plan for a direct user test together with Jorn, but this test never came to fruition due to all of us having to start working from home:

## My Learning Goals
During this project there were certain things I wanted to learn, these were:

### 1 - Learn to develop / debug efficiently in Unity for the Oculus Quest
I knew I didn't have to prove my expertise in programming for this project, so instead I wanted to focus on working with new hardware.
