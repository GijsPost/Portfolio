# Portfolio of Gijs

Welcome to my Portfolio for the minor Virtual Reality.

## Who am I?
I'm a 4th year HBO-ICT Software Engineer with a background in full-stack development for .NET.

## What am I working on? (My Group & My Role)
During this minor, we worked on a project together with the University of Amsterdam in collaboration with WeMakeVR. The goal of this project was to create a VR application that was to make the user more aware of the plastic garbage they produce. I worked on this application together in a team called Virtual Birds, with Mike Tetteroo, Mirre Kersenberg, Vincent Vlaanderen-Oldenzaal en Jorn van 't Hof. My role in this group was as a general developer, concept-designer, tester, as well as a guide for my group to become familiar with modern development tools and operations.

## The Concept
Our vision for the application of this project was the following:<br/>
_"A virtual reality experience for the Oculus Quest where the user plays a role in a time-travelling story which forces them to confront the plastic garbage they produce."_

We chose a time-travel story because it ties in neatly with what we wanted to get from the user. We wanted the user to go grocery shopping. More specifically; we wanted the user to do their own groceries of a week in the past. In our story, when the user is sent back to the past, the time-machine breaks, which results in the user having to do their own groceries to "fix the past". 

When the user gets sent to the future, they are confronted with the multiplication of the result of their grocery shopping in the form of a big pile of garbage. We do this to create a shock-effect. We do want the user to have the feeling that they can actually do something about this problem though, so we decided later on that the user should be able to reflect on and change the garbage they produce by means of converting their purchased groceries into their more eco-friendly, less-plastic alternatives.

## The Product
In a nutshell, this video walks through our product as we have it right now:

## User Testing
During the making of this application, we made a lot of assumptions and decisions which need to be proven by User Tests. Unfortunately, the covid-19 crisis was at the height of this project's development so User Testing with our target group (inexperienced VR-users) became quite difficult. Nevertheless we managed to cook up some testplans, one of which was to test with our peers who worked on other VR projects. Because one of my learning goals was learning to user test, the details of the Testing can be found under that learning goal.

## My Learning Goals
During this project there were certain things I wanted to learn, these were:

### 1 - Learn to develop / debug efficiently in Unity for the Oculus Quest
I knew I didn't have to prove my expertise in programming for this project, so instead I wanted to focus on working with new hardware. For this project we used the Oculus Quest as our target platform. It is a new piece of hardware with a promising future and a lot of developer tools still being worked on and released every day. So after seeing the scarcity of helpful tools on how to develop for the Quest, I decided to make it my goal to learn to work with this new hardware efficiently, and to publish my findings to the rest of the group.

#### Proof
The finished guide (as promised):

Extra In-Game Debugging console (made in the Unity VR Dev lessons):

#### Progress
I am under the impression that this learning goal is finished for me. My original objective has been achieved thanks to the Link cable and I created a nice guide for other people to use.

### 2 - Learn to make fun VR Interactions
As a (mainly) back-end programmer in a company i've been working on code for a long time and i rarely get to experience what it means for users to actually use the things I make. I wanted to change that by making and measuring how people interact with virtual objects in our experience.

#### Proof
The Interaction system can be seen in action here:

As for the User test, that can be found under the Learning goal User Testing.

#### Progress
While I have made an interaction system, I feel like I could expand upon it better, either by playing with weight, or two-handed pick-ups, etc. I don't think this will be within the scope of this project though.

### 3 - Learn to User Test
I have had 1 lesson in my first year where we tested our User Interface designs. However, that was all we were ever thought. And since we were now working with hardware that has a tremendously different effect on the user, I thought it would be a fun challenge to learn to test our VR application with our users.

#### Proof
I made this questionnaire together with an experienced User Tester in our team (Jorn). This questionnaire was to be filled in by testers after playing our application. The results of this test are presented here:

Before this, during sprint 2, I also made a test plan for a direct user test together with Jorn, but this test never came to fruition due to all of us having to start working from home:

Finally, to test my Interaction system, I made another testplan for a user test:

The results of which can be found here:

#### Progress
I feel like I have learned enough to say that this learning goal is also finished. I've made different types of plans and did different tests, cooperated with others on it, and did things myself. I've interacted with users and learned how to do that correctly.
